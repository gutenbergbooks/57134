<h2 class="center"><span class="small">CIRCULATING NATURE COLLECTIONS OF BIRDS IN THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY</span></h2>
<p>This Bird Study Manual is intended especially for the use of
teachers and pupils in the New York City Schools. It is written
primarily to describe the birds contained in the circulating nature
study collections which the American Museum of Natural History
loans to public schools. However it may be used as a general
guide to bird study as well. The various study outlines tell
the story of different projects that may be developed in connection
with birds. Typical birds are illustrated. As much as is possible
in the life history of each bird is given. The bird poems may be
used in connection with the study of English. The study of birds
may very well be correlated with the studies of many other subjects
such as Civics, Geography and other topics.</p>
<p>The purpose of the loan collections of birds and other animals in
the American Museum of Natural History is to place in the hands
of teachers good material for classroom instruction, At the same
time authoritative data is given with each collection. These loan
collections are available for any teacher in any school in Greater
New York.</p>
<p>The method of obtaining these collections has been made the
simplest possible as far as the teachers are concerned. At least
once a year (in September), and sometimes twice a year, a return
postal card is mailed to every school principal in the City system,
All that the principal has to do to obtain the collections is to
indicate by numerals the sequence in which he wants the collections
delivered, signing his name and school number. The Museum
messengers will then deliver the collections, and call for
them, without any more effort on the part of the schools. The
entire cost of this service is borne by the Museum.</p>
<p>Teachers are urged, whenever possible, to bring their classes to
the American Museum of Natural History, at 77th Street and
Central Park West, to take advantage of the opportunities for
further study that are offered. In the many halls of birds and
animals, the home life and the general habitat of the creatures are
given in detail. There is a free guide service for teachers and
pupils. Also there are classes for school children held in the new
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
School Service Building. In fact, the wealth of natural history
study material is always there, available in many ways for the use
of all who desire to further their knowledge of the animals of the
out-of-doors.</p>
<p>Applications for these collections and for further information
should be addressed to The American Museum of Natural History,
77th Street and Central Park West, New York City.

<hr />
<p>The American Museum of Natural History has five collections
of birds to lend to Public Schools. These five are:</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Bluebird Set</span></p>
<p>Bluebird&mdash;Phoebe&mdash;Barn Swallow&mdash;House Wren&mdash;Chimney Swift.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Owl Set</span></p>
<p>Chickadee&mdash;Nuthatch&mdash;Song Sparrow&mdash;Screech Owl&mdash;Kinglet.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Robin Set</span></p>
<p>Robin&mdash;Red-winged Blackbird&mdash;Baltimore Oriole&mdash;Chipping Sparrow&mdash;Meadowlark.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Blue Jay Set</span></p>
<p>Blue Jay&mdash;Downy Woodpeckcr&mdash;Starling&mdash;Junco&mdash;English Sparrow&mdash;Crossbill.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Scarlet Tanager Set</span></p>
<p>Scarlet Tanager&mdash;Red-eyed Vireo&mdash;Goldfinch&mdash;Hummingbird&mdash;Pigeon.</p>

<p>Insects&mdash;Sponges and Corals&mdash;Crustaceans&mdash;Minerals and Rocks&mdash;Native Woods&mdash;Starfishes and Worms&mdash;Mollusks.</p>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS</span></h2>
<p>It is sometimes helpful to study birds by the &ldquo;Question and
Answer&rdquo; method. The following questions are written to suggest
others of a similar nature.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">What is a Bird?</span> A bird is an animal that has feathers. No other
animal has feathers.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">OUTLINE FOR BIRD STUDY</span>
<br />(Suggestions to Teachers and Pupils)</h2>
<p>In observing birds out-of-doors or in the class room, with an idea
of studying or identifying them, there are certain definite things to
know and to remember. The following outline makes some suggestions
of what to look for when a bird is seen for the first time, or
when you are studying a mounted specimen or colored picture.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Movements:</span> See whether the flyer hops or walks when it is on the
ground. Does it hang upside down, move slowly or quickly,
swim or creep? Remember that the same bird may have a
different appearance at various times.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Disposition:</span> Did you ever think of a bird in connection with its
having a disposition? Notice whether it is unsuspicious,
wary, social, solitary, etc.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Flight:</span> Does the bird that flies over your head travel rapidly or
slowly? Does it flap along or does it sail and soar? Maybe it
undulates (flies up and then down in half-moon curves) as the
Goldfinch does.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> There are many times when you may hear a bird but not see
it. Thus you should listen for songs very carefully. Notice
whether the song is continuous, short, loud, low, pleasing,
unattractive, and whether it comes from the ground, from a
higher perch, or from the air.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Call Notes:</span> Nearly all birds have a <span class="sc">Call Note</span> that is different
from the regular song. These notes may be of various sorts
such as scolding, warning, alarm, signalling, as well as a
number of others.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Size:</span> In the field, you cannot run up to a wild bird and measure
it with a ruler, but what you can do is to compare it in size
with some other bird that you do know. Compare the unknown
bird with an English Sparrow which is about 6 inches
long, a Robin about 10 and a Crow 19 inches long. Remember,
6, 10 and 19.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Form:</span> Note the shape of the bill, length of the tail, shape of wings.</p>

<p class="pcap">&ldquo;BIRDS THAT ARE OUR FRIENDS&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pcapc">One of the new &ldquo;Habitat Group&rdquo; circulating nature-study collections. The label-holders are hinged to the back of the case and close over the ends, protecting
the glass during transportation. The label at the left is general and gives reasons why birds are our friends. That on the right deals with the habits and use
of the specific birds in the case, each being identified by a simple drawing instead of by title or number.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Markings and Color:</span> See just where the markings are. Remember
that if a bird were seen without feathers, it would
look quite a bit like any other animal. The next time you
have a chicken after the feathers have been removed, look
at it closely. The wings look like arms, and as a matter of
fact, they have three &ldquo;fingers,&rdquo; which may be easily seen.
The bird has a crown on its head; he has &ldquo;cheeks,&rdquo; a breast,
a throat, a belly, and a rump as well as other external or
outside parts. Do not say that you saw a bird that was &ldquo;black
and white and brown all over.&rdquo; No one could tell you what
sort of a bird that was. <i>See</i>&mdash;just what you are looking at.
As with the <span class="sc">Markings</span>, you should know something of the
parts of a bird before you are able to tell just where the colors
occur. How many colors are there on the under side of the
Robin?</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Appearance:</span> The bird may be alert, wide awake or pensive as
though it had just lost a friend. Its tail may be drooped,
its crest erected or its feathers ruffled.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Haunts:</span> Where did you see the bird? Was it near the seashore,
beside the river, in the woods, the fields, a place where the land
was low and swampy or high and rocky, or was it down near
the side of the lake?</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Season:</span> The time of year that the bird is seen is a very important
thing to notice and to take into consideration. Look for
the times when birds first arrive and when they leave. Did
you see them in the winter, spring, summer, or fall? Are they
permanent residents?</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> When you walked through the pasture or through the park
and saw a bird eating something, did you stop and try to discover
what that food was? Was the bird eating berries,
insects, seeds? How was this food secured?</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Mating:</span> Every bird has certain courtship habits. Note these
antics.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nesting:</span> Observe the choice of nesting site, the materials used
in the nests, such as mud, grass, leaves, and so on. Notice the
construction, the number and the color of the eggs; and
the incubation period, or the length of time the eggs take to
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
hatch; and above all things, <i>do not in any way disturb any
bird&rsquo;s nest</i>.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">The Young:</span> Watch and learn what food the young ones are given
by the parents; how they are cared for; the time they remain
in the nest; their cries, actions, first flights, and so on.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">How to Find Birds:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a)&mdash;<i>When</i>&mdash;The best times of day are early morning and late
afternoon. Why is this true?</p>
<p>(b)&mdash;<i>Where</i>&mdash;A watered meadow with trees here and there
attract birds. Learn this from observation.</p>
<p>(c)&mdash;<i>How</i>&mdash;Use common sense as to dress and general actions.
Sit down and let the birds come to you.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE BLUEBIRD</span></h2>
<p>In this locality some of the Bluebirds are with us all the year
through. However, they are not so often seen in winter as in
warmer summer months. The Starlings and the English Sparrows
have driven them from many former nesting sites.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The Bluebird eats many insects, including beetles, grasshoppers
and different kinds of caterpillars. He also often
feeds upon such fruits as cedar berries, wild cherries and
those of other wild plants.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Bill:</span> The bill of this bird is much like that of the Robin and the
Thrushes. These birds are very closely related.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Feet:</span> Being a typical perching bird, the Bluebird has very well
developed feet. The hind toe is larger than any of the front
ones and is of great value in grasping a twig or larger branch.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> When the Bluebird has found his mate, the pair begin their
search for a home. It may be in a hollow tree, fence post, or
in a box built by some friendly hand. Within the nesting
hole a bed of dried grass is made. Five or six pale blue eggs
are laid and then the new family is well on its way.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The song of the Bluebird, while not very lengthy, is very
soft and sweet. It has a musical tone and is one of the most
beautiful of the early Spring bird voices. The notes are
somewhat unsteady and have a tender, plaintive quality.</p>
<p>John Burroughs has said of the Bluebird:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And yonder Bluebird, with the earth tinge on his breast and
the sky tinge on his back, did he come down out of heaven on
that bright March morning when he told us so softly and
plaintively that, if we pleased, Spring had come?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Cullen Bryant has written:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When beechen buds begin to swell,</p>
<p class="t0">And woods the Bluebird&rsquo;s warble know,</p>
<p class="t0">The yellow violet&rsquo;s modest bell</p>
<p class="t0">Peeps from last year&rsquo;s leaves below.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And Lowell:&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">From post to post along the cheerless fence.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE PHOEBE</span></h2>
<p>Toward the end of March, the peaceful, confiding Phoebe
ventures northward. Sometimes ice and snow greet the little
bird, but on he goes to take the weather as it comes. The return
journey to the far south does not begin until the first frosty
nights of September tell the story of approaching winter.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> At the time of the Phoebe&rsquo;s arrival, some of the first flying
insects are trying their wings. As the Phoebe is a flycatcher,
he may be seen, darting and wheeling about, in pursuit of his
food. The snap of his beak may be heard as some small
creature is overtaken and swallowed. Beetles, weevils, flies,
grasshoppers and other insects help to feed this bird.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Bill:</span> The bill of the Phoebe is admirably adapted to its feeding
habits. This Quill is quite broad and strong. Upon each
side are small &ldquo;bristles&rdquo; which help the bird to feed while
flying. How do these &ldquo;bristles&rdquo; help?</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Wings</span> and <span class="sc">Tail</span>: The Phoebe is an expert in the air. His wings
and tail are comparatively long and powerful. Compare
them with those of the Wren. Which one of the two is the best
flier? Why?</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> While resting and while watching for insects, the Phoebe
often perches upon the end of a branch or fence post and sings&mdash;&ldquo;<i>pewit-phoebe-phoebe-phoebe</i>.&rdquo;
At the same time, he moves
his tail with a sideway sweep, in a jerky little way. He is not
much of a singer, but when the sound, &ldquo;<i>phoebe-phoebe</i>&rdquo;
comes to us in March or early April, we know that Spring
will soon be here.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Phoebe is well built of mud, moss and other
materials. It is sometimes lined with wool and feathers.
The structure is placed on some flat surface, such as upon a
rafter beneath a bridge or in a barn. Occasionally the nest is
built under some sheltering bank or cliff. The eggs are
usually white.</p>
<p>Of the Phoebe, Lowell has written:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Phoebe is all it has to say,</p>
<p class="t0">In plaintive cadence o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er</p>
<p class="t0">Like children that have lost their way</p>
<p class="t0">And know their names, but nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE BARN SWALLOW</span></h2>
<p>The Barn Swallows arrive in the North toward the end of April
and leave early in September. They are sociable birds and travel
in huge flocks.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> Insects, caught upon the wing, form the diet of those
Swallows. They dart here and there, over field and water,
catching their prey in swift, graceful flight.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Feet:</span> Often, in the season of migration, thousands of Swallows
perch upon telephone wires, sometimes in such large numbers
that the wires are broken. Their small feet are well suited for
this, but not for walking upon the ground.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Tail:</span> The tail of the Barn Swallow is deeply forked. When
perched, these long protruding outer tail feathers serve to
distinguish the Barn Swallow from all other native Swallows.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The gentle twitter of the Barn Swallow is a familiar sound
about many a farm where an old barn or other outbuilding
may provide a nesting site. It is a musical sound that changes
to a &ldquo;<i>kit-tic&mdash;kit-tic</i>&rdquo; when the bird becomes excited.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The cup-shaped nest of the Barn Swallow is made of mud
and is lined with grass and feathers. It is stuck to the side of a
rafter or beam or against the inside of the weather-boarding of
an old barn where a broken window pane or other hole admits
the bird from the out-of-doors. The eggs are white, speckled
with brown and lavender.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE TREE SWALLOW</p>
<p class="pcapc">Tree Swallows nest both in hollow trees and in nesting boxes
that man has erected for their use. The upper parts of this bird
are of a blue-green color while the under parts are of a pure white.
When going to the south they collect in huge flocks and, after
having flown high into the air, they begin their journey in the daytime.
At Long Beach, Long Island, thousands of them have been
observed feeding upon the bayberry bushes just before they
started south.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE HOUSE WREN</span></h2>
<p>Some day, late in April, the House Wren will appear to add to
the growing bird population. Not until the middle of August
or the end of September will he depart. He is the most common
of our Wrens.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> Ninety-eight percent of the food of this small bird is made
up of insects.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Actions:</span> These little birds are very restless. They seem never to
be still. From dawn to dark they are bobbing, hopping,
and bowing about with tireless energy. The stiff tail, constantly
jerked, is usually in an upright perky position, and is
a true mark of the Wren&rsquo;s personality.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The House Wren is more noted for the quantity of his song
than for the quality. Although parts of his singing are soft
and musical, there are other times when scolding, grating
notes mar the performance. Constantly singing, the Wren
goes about his work. Even when flying or perching with a
worm in his beak, he will sing away as though the thoughts
of mere food were far indeed from his mind. The true song is
a spontaneous and rollicking outburst, and is sung with real
abandon that fairly makes the small feathered body tremble
with the force of its effort.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the House Wren is made within some cavity,
either natural or man-made. If no hollow tree is about, an
eave spout will do, provided that an English Sparrow has not
found it first. Wrens have even been known to build their
nests in old shoes! The material used consists of grass and
short twigs, feathers and like material. The eggs, sometimes
as many as eight in number, are thickly speckled with
pinkish brown.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Flight:</span> The flight of the Wren is very erratic. It darts here and
there with much speed. Although not a very strong flier,
the bird travels in many places that larger birds could never
manage.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE CHIMNEY SWIFT</span></h2>
<p>The Chimney Swift, which is in no way related to the Swallows,
is seen in the North toward the end of April or early in May.
From the last weeks of August until late in September, southward
bound flocks may be seen, and then the bird has left us
until Spring comes again.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The Swifts feed entirely while flying. They eat small
flying insects of many kinds, catching them chiefly in the
early morning and late afternoon.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Feet:</span> Seldom does the Swift alight upon any flat-topped object.
Its characteristic perching place is upon some rough-surfaced
tree or chimney where the small, weak feet cling to the wall
and hold the bird in an upright position.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Tail:</span> The tail of the Chimney Swift is used as a prop to aid the
bird in holding fast to vertical surfaces. The feathers of this
fan-shaped prop are spine-tipped.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Wings and Body:</span> The body of the Swift is &ldquo;cigar shaped.&rdquo;
The wings are slender though powerful and have long outer
feathers that help him to fly for hours at a time.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The Chimney Swift has no true song. His singing efforts
result in a &ldquo;<i>chip-chip-chip</i>&rdquo; repeated over and over again,
with a twitter-like rhythm, sometimes sounding &ldquo;<i>chippy-chippy-chippy-chip</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of this bird is an unusual structure made of twigs
that are glued together with its glutinous saliva. It forms a
shallow, saucer-shaped platform in which the small white
eggs are laid. Before man-made chimneys offered nesting
sites, the Swifts built in hollow trees.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE CHICKADEE</span></h2>
<p>The friendly, sometimes inquisitive Chickadees, are with us all
through the year. Ever active, they fly here and there searching
for food, and giving their cheerful calls.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Bill:</span> The tweezer-like bill of this little bird is very well adapted to
the catching and eating of small insects and their eggs.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Habits:</span> The Chickadees are never strangers to one who walks
within sight or hearing of them. They fly very near and have
even been known to perch upon the hand of different bird
watchers who have sufficiently gained their confidence. The
gray and black colors of these small balls of feathers match
the tree trunks and branches upon which the Chickadees
climb and hang in search of food.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The Chickadee tells his own name when he sings. Ella G.
Ives has said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I know a little minister who has a big degree;</p>
<p class="t0">Just like a long-tailed kite, he flies his D. D. D. D.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Chickadee-dee-dee!&rdquo; is the music that comes from this
small gymnast of the branches. Sometimes a &ldquo;Phoebe&rdquo; call note
is also given. It is quite simple to imitate this note by
whistling. If you do it correctly the Chickadee may answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> An old, hollow stump or fence post is often chosen by the
Chickadee for a home. The nest within is built of moss,
plant fibers, grasses, and feathers. From five to nine eggs are
laid. They are of a white color spotted with a ruddy brown.</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson admired the Chickadee who braved the
winter&rsquo;s cold, and seemed so happy in the very coldest of weather.
He wrote this about the little bird:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This scrap of valor just for play</p>
<p class="t0">Fronts the north wind in waistcoat gray,</p>
<p class="t0">As if to shame my weak behavior.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH</span></h2>
<p>The Nuthatch is one of the tree trunk birds that, in the wintertime,
is a close friend of the Chickadees and the Downy Woodpeckers.
He is with us all the year around. Some people have
called him the &ldquo;Upside down bird&rdquo; due to the fact that he is able
to run up and down the trunks of trees in almost every conceivable
position.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The food of the Nuthatch consists of the small insects that
live under and upon the bark of trees. The small, sharp
pointed beak is well adapted to pry off sections of loose bark
that may house some eggs, larvae or pupae of insects that
are hidden for the cold months.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Habits:</span> Edith M. Thomas has written a little poem about the
Nuthatch. It is a good description of the acrobatic powers of
these little gray birds of the woods.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Shrewd little haunter of woods all gray,</p>
<p class="t0">Whom I met on my walk of a winter day&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">You&rsquo;re busy inspecting each cranny and hole</p>
<p class="t0">In the ragged bark of a hickory bole;</p>
<p class="t0">You intent on your task, and I on the law</p>
<p class="t0">Of your wonderful head and gymnastic claw!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Woodpecker may well despair of this feat&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Only the fly with you can compete!</p>
<p class="t0">So much is clear; but I fain would know</p>
<p class="t0">How you can so reckless and fearless go,</p>
<p class="t0">Head upward, head downward, all one to you,</p>
<p class="t0">Zenith and nadir, the same in your view.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Nuthatch is located in a hole in a tree or
stump. It is lined with feathers, leaves and other similar
materials. The white eggs are thickly speckled with a rufous
and lavender color. From five to eight eggs are laid.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> Some one has described the song of this bird as being like
the laugh of a very old man. As the Nuthatch pauses from
his work to inspect you, he may suddenly decide that you are
no longer worthy of his attention. With a harsh little &ldquo;yank-yank,&rdquo;
he will then continue his insect hunting and leave you
to marvel at his actions.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE SONG SPARROW</span></h2>
<p>The Song Sparrow is a member of a very large family. His near
relations are found in many regions of the earth. In winter, fall
and spring, he is with us to represent his kind, and a fine representative
he is, with his good spirits and ever-ready song.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Field Marks:</span> The red-brown line behind the Song Sparrow&rsquo;s
eye, combined with the tiny splash of black and brown which
streaks his breast are two marks by which the bird may be
identified. The larger blotch of color upon the breast is in
the center of the &ldquo;splash.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> This Sparrow is a musician of fine ability. The call note is
but a metallic &ldquo;<i>chip</i>.&rdquo; The homing song is worthy of the attention
of any one who likes to hear good music in the out-of-doors.
There is no one song but rather a combination of
songs which are varied from time to time. The beginning
of the song is usually of three sustained introductory notes.
The following notes rise in rapid succession and are of a pure
musical quality. The strain is a cheerful, simple melody.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Song Sparrow is built either upon the ground
or in bushes. It is made of coarse grasses, rootlets, dead leaves,
strips of bark and similar materials. The eggs, four or five in
number, are of a bluish white with brownish markings which
are often so numerous that they conceal the underlying color.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The diet of the Song Sparrow consists largely of the seeds of
harmful weeds. It also feeds upon insects such as ants,
beetles, and weevils. The beak of this Sparrow is comparatively
large and strong. It is well adapted to open large seed
pods in order to reach and eat the kernel within.</p>
<p>Henry Van Dyke has written a little poem about the Song
Sparrow. The first stanza of the poem, from &ldquo;Builders and Other
Poems&rdquo; is given here:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is a bird I know so well,</p>
<p class="t0">It seems as if he must have sung</p>
<p class="t0">Beside my crib when I was young;</p>
<p class="t0">Before I knew the way to spell</p>
<p class="t">The name of even the smallest bird,</p>
<p class="t">His gentle, joyful song I heard.</p>
<p class="t0">Now see if you can tell, my dear,</p>
<p class="t0">What bird it is that every year,</p>
<p class="t0">Sings, &ldquo;Sweet-sweet-sweet, very merry cheer.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">SCREECH OWL</span></h2>
<p>This little permanent resident is quite common in the outlying
sections of the cities. He seems to care for the society of man.
Very often, he is to be found near human dwellings rather than far
out in the woods. Just why we should call this bird the &ldquo;Screech
Owl&rdquo; is somewhat of a mystery. The Owl has a tremulous,
quavering voice that in no way suggests a &ldquo;screech.&rdquo; Perhaps
it is that the name has come to us from Europe. At any event, it is
not appropriate to our small Owl.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> Sometimes in walks out-of-doors we may come upon small,
gray colored pellets made of hair and tiny bones. Very often,
these have been ejected by the Screech Owl, who is able to
digest the flesh of his prey but not the skeleton and the outer
covering. This beneficial night flier feeds upon mice and
other creatures. His sharp, hooked beak is adapted to tearing
food and his rather long and pointed little talons are of great
use in grasping it.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Color:</span> There are two color phases of the Screech Owl. One is a
mixture of mottled reddish brown, and the other a brownish
gray shade tinged with black. These two phases have nothing
to do either with sex, age, or season.</p>
<p class="revint">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ears:</span>&rdquo; The two small tufts, one on either side of the head, are
not ears at all. They are merely feathers. They may well
serve to distinguish this bird from the Acadian or Saw-whet
Owl which is not at all common.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Screech Owl is often placed in a hole in a
hollow tree. The pure white eggs, some five or six in number,
are laid in April.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When night time comes, the Whip-poor-will sings,</p>
<p class="t0">The Owl sails off on noiseless wings</p>
<p class="t0">To search for mice and other things;</p>
<p class="t0">And I go home to bed.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE KINGLETS</span></h2>
<p>There are two varieties of Kinglets in this section of the country,
the Golden-crowned and the Ruby-crowned. Both members
of the family are beautiful little birds that visit us in autumn and
depart in the spring. They are not with us during the warmer
months. In the coldest time of the year these little, restless
wanderers among the trees may be seen and heard. Except for the
Humming-bird and the Winter Wren, the Kinglets are the smallest
birds that we have.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Ruby-Crowned Kinglet</span></h3>
<p>The male bird may be identified by the partly concealed tiny
crest of red which the bird often raises.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Golden-Crowned Kinglet</span></h3>
<p>A crest of gold marks this cousin of the Ruby-crowned. Often
no color is visible upon the head except the uniform olive or greenish
tinge. However, when the bird is excited, the crest is raised and it
is then that the color of the crown may be very well seen.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Habits:</span> The Kinglets are friendly birds that often come very
near. They seem to be much more tame than the warblers.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> A constant search for tiny insects occupies the time of the
Kinglets.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The Ruby-crown is the superior singer of the two. His
song consists of a loud, clear warble, interrupted here and
there with a wren-like chatter. The Golden-crown&rsquo;s song may
be expressed as &ldquo;tzze, tzze, tzze, tzze, ti, ti, tir, t-t-t-.&rdquo; The call
note is an extremely high-pitched &ldquo;ti-ti.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The roundish nests of the Kinglets are made of moss, thin
strips of inner bark, feathers and other like materials. These
nests are made in evergreen trees and are sometimes placed as
high as sixty feet above the ground.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">ROBIN</span></h2>
<p>Our native Robin is not closely related to the bird that the
English call &ldquo;Robin Redbreast.&rdquo; He is rather a relative of the
Bluebird and the Thrush. Before the young of the Robin leave
the nest, their breasts are speckled as are the breasts of the Thrushes.
After the first moult, this marking disappears. Some of the Robins
are with us all through the year. However, only the hardiest of
them stay during the Winter. The majority travel to the
warmer climates. Those who come to us from the South arrive
about the first of March and depart toward the end of October.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc"><span class="sc">Song:</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In the sunshine and the rain</p>
<p class="t0">I hear the robin in the lane</p>
<p class="t0">Singing. &lsquo;Cheerily,</p>
<p class="t0">Cheer up, cheer up;</p>
<p class="t0">Cheerily, Cheerily, Cheerily, Cheer up&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A writer in &ldquo;A Masque of Poets&rdquo; has described the cheer in the
Robin&rsquo;s song very well. Robin music has real melody and expression.
Indeed, there are very few of our birds that have what
might be called as great a vocabulary, or as many expressive
notes, as has this familiar bird.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Robin is built of grasses, rootlets and leaves.
The interior is well lined or plastered with a layer of mud.
Another layer of fine grass forms the bed upon which the
greenish blue eggs are laid. These eggs are from three to
five in number. Robins often raise two families each year.
The young of the first brood leave the nest toward the first of
July.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> In June and July, Robins feed to some extent upon berries
and similar fruits. However, what little harm they may do in
this way is vastly offset by the good that is done during the rest
of the year. The Robins are gleaners of insects. They eat
great quantities of beetles and their grubs, grasshoppers,
crickets, ants and other plant pests. One of the most comical
sights of bird feeding is to see a large, round, healthy Robin
struggle to pull a resisting, equally healthy, earthworm from its
hole in the ground. Often, the worm breaks in two and the
Robin, suddenly and most unexpectedly, tumbles over
backward. The Robin seems to &ldquo;Listen&rdquo; for the worm as
he walks and hops over the lawn in the early morning.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD</span></h2>
<p>Early in March, the male Redwing arrives. It is not until two
or three weeks later that the female comes from the south to
join his company and to sail about over the cat-tails of the marsh.
When August has gone by, the adult Blackbirds are seldom seen.
It is in July that the young and old birds congregate in large
flocks to prepare themselves for the journey southward. Red-winged
Blackbirds from farther north may be seen as late as
October.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Markings:</span> The male Red-winged Blackbird is of a faultless
glossy black with shoulder patches, or epaulets, of a bright
scarlet, edged with gold. His mate is of a more sober appearance&mdash;streaked
with modest brown.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> Henry D. Thoreau described the Red-winged Blackbird&rsquo;s
song as&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Chonk-a-ree</i>.&rdquo; These free, truly bubbling notes are
given again and again as the birds go about their everyday
tasks in the Spring. The arrival of the females, however, is
perhaps the signal for the greatest singing effort on the part
of the males. It is at this time, especially, that the marshland
is fairly alive with the rich reed-like song that
repeats&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Conk-a-ree</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Conk-a-ree</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Conk-a-ree</i>&rdquo;!</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of this bird is woven of grasses, weed-stalks and
rootlets. Sometimes it is built in a friendly, compact mass
of cat-tail, and other nests may be seen in low bushes or tussocks.
These Redwings do not welcome visitors to their nesting
sites. They raise very strenuous objections, and, in their
attempt to drive away the intruder, bird, beast or man, they
will fly very near, scolding in harsh tones the meanwhile.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Eggs:</span> The eggs of the Red-winged Blackbirds are truly unusual in
their markings. They are of a pale blue ground, or base
color, and are often scrawled over with a dark purple or black.
They appear to have been stepped upon by a bird that has
first dipped its toes in a bottle of ink. These eggs are from
three to five in number.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">BALTIMORE ORIOLE</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How comes it, Oriole, thou hast come to fly</p>
<p class="t0">In tropic splendor through our northern sky?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Edgar Fawcett asks this question in his poem. Who is there
that may answer him? The Baltimore Oriole comes to us in
early May and stays until about the first of September. This
bird, sometimes called the Golden Robin, is a namesake of George
Calvert, or Lord Baltimore, who was the first proprietor of
Maryland. Indeed, he does seem &ldquo;golden&rdquo; as he flashes about
among green leaves. However, he is a relation of the blackbirds,
rather than of the robins.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Colors:</span> The brilliant orange and black feathers of the Oriole are
the marks by which the bird may be identified. The head,
shoulders and neck, and the upper section of the back are of a
gleaming black. The breast is of a bright orange, sometimes
almost golden in its color.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> A loud, sometimes bold, whistle from the top of a sweeping
elm tree often announces the presence of the Baltimore
Oriole. He is a fine songster of considerable ability. His
song is characterized by a richness that gives a truly musical
quality to his efforts.</p>
<p>The same poet asks further:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At some glad moment was it Nature&rsquo;s choice and charm</p>
<p class="t0">To dower a scrap of sunset with a voice?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The beautiful hanging nest of the Baltimore Oriole is often
suspended from the end of the branch of some shade tree,
where it sways with every passing breeze. It is composed of
hair, strings, grasses, bark lining and other similar materials
all closely interwoven with the greatest of skill. The eggs, four
to six in number, are of a white color marked with wavy
blackish lines and spots. This bird has been known to make
very good use of yarn, string, and even strips of cloth, placed
where they might easily be found and woven into the nest.
Some nests built almost entirely of string have been found.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">CHIPPING SPARROW</span></h2>
<p>The sociable personality of the Chipping Sparrow enables the
bird student to make his close acquaintance. He is a little bird of
modest habits, who shows his trust in the human race by living
very near to the homes of man. In early April &ldquo;Chippy&rdquo; arrives.
He leaves for the South about the first of November.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> &ldquo;<i>Chippy&mdash;Chippy&mdash;Chippy</i>&rdquo; is all this small Sparrow has to
say. Certainly, this is not an especially attractive song, and
yet it is very much in keeping with the unassuming disposition
of the bird. It could scarcely be called a song. It is
an extremely high pitched note with very little musical
quality. Nevertheless, somewhat monotonous though the
songs may be, they seem to have a peculiarly friendly air,
that, at times, is very welcome.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> Injurious insects are eaten in large quantities by the Chipping
Sparrows. Beetles, grasshoppers and other similar
insects are the prey of this bird. Many different types of
seeds constitute the rest of the diet. &ldquo;Chippy&rdquo; will readily
accept human hospitality whenever crumbs are scattered,
provided, of course, that the English Sparrow does not
arrive at the feeding station first.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Chipping Sparrow is built in bushes, shrubs,
trees, or in the old vines that grow about country houses.
The nest is lined with long hairs. One often wonders where
the bird finds so many of them. Grass and fine twigs are
used for the main construction of the home.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> The little chestnut cap of the Chipping Sparrow is
perhaps his most noticeable marking. By this, and by his
small size, he may be readily identified. He is sometimes
called the &ldquo;Least&rdquo; Sparrow. Like some other members
of the Sparrow family, he sometimes awakes in the middle of
the night and bursts into song.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE MEADOWLARK</span></h2>
<p>This bird of the fields may be seen during every month of the
year. After walking among the grasses, it may suddenly fly up
and may be identified by the conspicuous white outer tail feathers
which flash in the sunlight.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Field Marks:</span> The black crescent upon the yellow breast of the
Meadowlark is a fine field mark. In the early morning, when a
rising sun shines upon the open meadows, this bright yellow
patch seems to be, in itself, a reflected spot of golden light.
In winter, a brownish tone, more like the dried swamp
grasses, covers the plumage.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> Insects form the major portion of food for this guardian
of the hay fields. Sow-bugs, weevils, grasshoppers, ticks,
plant-lice and other enemies of the farmer all fall prey to the
pointed, searching beak.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The beautiful little nest, sometimes arched over, is built of
dry grass. It lies hidden upon the ground, often defying the
keenest of eyes of hawk and man alike. The eggs are white,
speckled with a reddish brown color. They may number
from four to six.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The music of this ground bird is somewhat sad. A slurred
whistle, rising from the grass in spring and early summer,
tells of the hiding place of the Meadowlark, singing in a
plaintive minor key. Sometimes this song comes from the
air. Its clear notes may be heard all through the year.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc"><i>Spring o&rsquo; the Year</i></p>
<p class="t0">The Meadowlark&rsquo;s song is &ldquo;Spring o&rsquo; the year,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t4">As he flies o&rsquo;er fields of hay;</p>
<p class="t0">He sings of his toil and not of the cheer</p>
<p class="t4">That lies in a land far away.</p>
</div>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> The protective coloration of the Meadowlark is of
great help to the bird. The soft brown and ground colors aid
it in escaping such enemies as Hawks and other preying
creatures. To a soaring bird of prey, the Meadowlark must
seem to be only a section of the ground upon which it walks.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE BLUE JAY</span></h2>
<p>The Blue Jay is closely related to the Crow. He shows this
relationship in a number of ways. He is very intelligent, has a
keen sense of humor and is an observer of birds and men. All
the year long he makes himself known to us by his striking plumage,
loud voice, and active body. During the nesting season, however,
he is comparatively quiet and we see little of him.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> During eight or nine months of the year the Blue Jay earns
an honest living. He eats many harmful insects, frogs,
snails, and even small fish and mice. In the breeding season,
however, the Jay sometimes turns robber and has been known
to steal the young of other birds. Nevertheless the Jay is a
likable creature, and probably before human beings came to
disturb him he was not quite so much of a nuisance to other
birds as he is now.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The clearly whistled note of this bird proclaims the name
<i>Jay!&mdash;Jay!&mdash;Jay!</i> in loud, harsh, ringing notes. Sometimes
the song is quite pleasing with a bell-like quality. Some think
that when the Jay calls he says <i>Thief! Thief! Thief!</i></p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The Blue Jay often constructs his nest in a convenient
crotch of a tree. It is built of twigs quite strongly interwoven.
The lining is of leaflets. The inside of the nest is not
by any means soft. The pale olive brown or green eggs
sprinkled with brownish are from four to six in number.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> It is in the winter time that we really know the Jay in
motion. When the snow is on the ground and the woods and
fields are quiet it seems a fine thing to see dashing through
the branches, calling again and again, a bright bluish bird
who gives an entirely different atmosphere to the outdoors.
Being something of a mimic, he sometimes takes delight in
imitating the songs of such birds as the Red-shouldered Hawk
and other songs that have a similar ring. He has been called
a reprobate, but, despite his bad habits, who is there that does
not appreciate his vivacity and ever-active personality?</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">DOWNY WOODPECKER</span></h2>
<p>This little member of the Woodpecker family is a permanent
resident with us. All the year through he is to be seen busily
engaged in his life work, which is a constant search for food.
The Downy Woodpecker may be distinguished from the Hairy
Woodpecker mainly by its smaller size and by its outer tail feathers
which are barred with black.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The food of nearly all Woodpeckers consists of insect
material that is found on or within the bark of trees. Thus
when the Downy Woodpecker is searching for food, he may
be seen upon the tree trunks or even hanging beneath branches
pecking away, excavating and digging. To name the injurious
insects that form this Woodpecker&rsquo;s diet would take a
long list. &ldquo;Every stroke with which he knocks at the door
of an insect&rsquo;s retreat sounds the crack of doom. He pierces
the bark with his beak, then with his barbed tongue drags
forth an insect, and moves on to tap a last summons on the
door of the next in line.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The Downy Woodpecker makes his own home. He uses
his beak for a chisel and for a pick, and digs away at some
hollow tree stump making a neat little round hole that leads
to a cavity wherein the white eggs are laid. By way of a bed
for these eggs the Woodpecker uses a few soft chips. These
same holes are often used the next season by some little Chickadee
who is only too glad to take advantage of his opportunity.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> In addition to tapping or drumming upon a hollow stump,
thus making a noise like a tiny drummer, the Downy Woodpecker
also has a sort of song. The notes are rather business-like
and come through the woods industriously,&mdash;in rapid
succession&mdash;<i>peek-peek-peek!</i> Sometimes, especially when interrupted,
the notes may sound like <i>chink-chink-chink!</i></p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> In the winter time the Downy Woodpecker leads a
rather solitary life flying about in the woods, searching here
and there, calling now and then, and patiently waiting for
the return of Spring. In the Spring, however, when the mating
season comes again, the Downy takes a new interest in
life, becomes more active and generally shows himself to be
very well aware of the fact that soon he must expect to work
upon his new home. It is at this time that the call note
<i>peek-peek-peek!</i> comes more sharply than ever.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE STARLING</span></h2>
<p>Like the English Sparrow, the Common Starling has become a
Naturalized American Citizen. He was introduced from Europe
in 1890, when sixty of his kind were released in Central Park,
New York City. He is a very permanent resident wherever he has
spread, and, because of the fact that he often ousts local or native
birds, he is somewhat objectionable.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The song of the Starling has many attractive notes. The
whistles are especially appreciated by city dwellers who
seldom hear the songs of more gifted birds. An indescribable
jumble of notes characterizes the remainder of the Starling&rsquo;s
musical efforts. William H. Hudson has written a very good
description of this bird&rsquo;s song&mdash;&ldquo;His merit lies less in the
quality of the sounds he utters than in their endless variety.
In a leisurely way he will sometimes ramble on for an hour,
whistling and warbling very agreeably, mingling his finer
notes with chatterings, squealings and sounds as of snapping
the fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The Starling will build in crevices of buildings, in hollow
trees or in bird houses erected for the use of other birds.
The nesting material consists of grasses, straw, twigs and
other available material. The eggs, four to six in number,
are of a pale bluish color.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The Starling eats a great number of insects. Cultivated
cherries, unfortunately, also, are very well liked by the bird
who feeds upon them quite often during the breeding season.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> The plumage of the male Starling is quite beautiful.
It is of an irridescent, metallic color in the spring and summer.
In the winter, a brownish gray obscures the more
brilliant colors. The bill of the bird is yellow in summer,
but dark horn-color in winter.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">JUNCO</span></h2>
<p>The slate-colored Junco comes down from the North to spend
the winter in a more moderate climate. He may be first seen
toward the last of September. The departure for the North is
made about the first of May. They are certainly welcome visitors,
coming as they do when most of our smaller birds have gone on
further South. In small flocks, these plump little birds hop and
fly, here and there, over the snow, searching for weed seeds and
other food.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The notes that are more frequently heard are sharp little
&ldquo;<i>tsips</i>&rdquo; given rather as a call note than as a song. The true
music or regular song of the Junco is a decidedly musical
trill. Sometimes, when disturbed, the birds will utter a
short &ldquo;<i>smack!</i>&rdquo; and fly to some other place where they may
be uninterrupted in their hunting.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Markings:</span> The Junco is a very trim little bird, with a somewhat
stylish appearance. He is quite plump and has a covering of
neat slate color above and upon the throat in a &ldquo;bib&rdquo; formation.
The belly is white. Two very conspicuous white
outer tail feathers are the most striking identification marks.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Bill:</span> This bird is a member of the Sparrow family. He has a
thick, pointed little bill that is of great service in crushing
seeds. When the sun shines directly through this bill, a
flesh-colored pink is shown.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The Junco nests from northern New York and New
England, northward. The nest is made of fine rootlets,
grasses, and moss, interwoven and built upon the ground or
just above in small bushes, and lined with hairs.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> The sociability of the Junco is mainly responsible for
his traveling in small flocks during the winter time. Crumbs
and similar foods are greatly welcomed by this bird, who
will often come quite near to human homes if sufficiently
invited. The flash of white and gray is a welcome sight
as a small band of these birds comes flying into the garden
when the clouds above are heavy and gray with oncoming
snow. It is at this time that we most appreciate their
company.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE ENGLISH SPARROW</span></h2>
<p>The English Sparrow is most often referred to as a pest. It is a
permanent resident in more senses than one. It was in 1851 and
1852 at Brooklyn, New York, that the small bird was first introduced.
During the first 20 years or so it was mostly confined
to the larger cities in the east. However, due to the bird&rsquo;s rapid
increase it has spread throughout every State in the Union and has
proved itself to be truly a great nuisance. Native birds have
been driven from their homes and have been robbed of much of
their food and many of their nesting sites.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The English Sparrow has no true song, but rather is content
to call <i>Chirp&mdash;Chirp&mdash;Chirp&mdash;Chirp!</i> over and over again.
Sometimes, in the larger cities such as New York, far from
the parks where no other birds would probably be, the hardy
little Sparrow is welcomed by the children to whom, without
him, bird life would be entirely a closed book. Thus it is
that the <i>chirp-chirp-chirp!</i> is not unwelcome everywhere.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> Dr. Frank M. Chapman has said that the English Sparrow
builds its nest of any available material, in any available
place. Behind window shutters, in upturned eave spouts
and gutters, beneath roofs, in holes in trees and in almost
every conceivable place, this bird makes its home. The
eggs, four to seven in number, vary greatly in coloration.
Sometimes they are plain white, sometimes almost completely
colored with olive brown. They are often marked with
olive.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> Even though this little bird is truly a pest it seems a
shame to criticize him in too harsh terms. After all, it is not
his fault that he was brought to a country whose climate
and general living conditions proved to be exactly what he
wanted. He has thrived because his adopted habitat has
proved to be ideal. Let us not confuse this bird in any way
with our truly native sparrows whose habits are so entirely
different from this little English Colonist. The names of
some of our North American birds of the same family are
the field sparrow, the song sparrow, the vesper sparrow and
many others whose lives, unfortunately, are not nearly so
well known.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">SCARLET TANAGER</span></h2>
<p>The Tanagers do not winter north of the Mexican border. In
the summer there are four species that occur in the United States,
only two of which inhabit this section of the country. The Scarlet
Tanager is one of the most common of these. He arrives early in
May and departs early in October. These beautiful birds are not
often seen unless we look up into the trees. The male bird, with
his truly startling colors, is a sight to remember. The wings and
tail are a jet black and the rest of the body is a remarkable scarlet.
The female is more modestly marked with olive.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The song of the Scarlet Tanager resembles that of a Robin,
but is much more throaty or buzzy,&mdash;causing one to think of
a Robin singing with a cold in his syrinx. John Burroughs
has referred to it as a &ldquo;proud gorgeous strain.&rdquo; The tones
have a truly &ldquo;proud&rdquo; quality, and well express the feelings
of one who would like to lie idle in the woods to fully enjoy
the content and peace of a warm spring day. They suggest
the quiet of a <i>tired</i> bumblebee droning his way homeward at
the end of a hard day&rsquo;s work. The call note has been represented
as &ldquo;<i>Chip-churr&mdash;chip-churr</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of this bird is made of stems, rootlets, and strips
of bark. It is sometimes quite loosely constructed and is
placed upon the outspreading limb of a tree sometimes as
high as forty feet. The eggs, three to five in number, are of a
greenish blue blotched with a chestnut color.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The Scarlet Tanager destroys numerous harmful insects
and is for this reason a very beneficial bird. Click-beetles,
crane-flies, weevils and numerous caterpillars form a large
part of his diet. The Tanager also eats some vegetable food
such as small fruits, berries and the seeds of plants, most of
which are wild.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> The male Summer Tanager, which is another species, is
of dull red above and a vermilion beneath. The female of
this relation of the Scarlet Tanager is of a yellowish green
above with a dull yellow upon the underside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These Tanagers are truly tropical in their appearance.
They are animated touches of color that seem somehow to be
foreign to our Northern woods.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">RED-EYED VIREO</span></h2>
<p>Except for the Catbird, the most talkative bird that we know is
the Red-eyed Vireo. He is first to be seen in late April. When
October has come, the Red-eye travels Southward. All through
the warm days of spring and summer, this persistent little bird
sings and sings. Mr. Wilson Flagg has called him &ldquo;The Preacher
Bird.&rdquo; This title is indeed well earned for he seems to say, over
and over&mdash;&ldquo;You see me&mdash;I see you&mdash;do you hear me? Do you
believe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The pendant nest of the Red-eyed Vireo hangs from a
forked branch. It is made of small bits of dead wood, plant
down, paper and strips of thin bark all very neatly interwoven
to form a tiny bird basket. The eggs, three to four in
number, are of a white color with a few specks of brown or
umber upon the larger end. Frequently the Cowbird leaves
her egg in this little bird&rsquo;s nest. This poem by Faith C. Lee,
in <i>Bird-Lore</i>, gives one person&rsquo;s opinion of the Cowbird.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lc"><i>Red-Eyed Vireo</i></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When overhead you hear a bird</p>
<p class="t">Who talks, or rather chatters,</p>
<p class="t0">Of all the latest woodland news,</p>
<p class="t">And other trivial matters,</p>
<p class="t0">Who is so kind, so very kind,</p>
<p class="t">She never can say no.</p>
<p class="t0">And so the nasty Cowbird</p>
<p class="t">Drops an egg among her row</p>
<p class="t0">Of neat white eggs. Behold her then,</p>
<p class="t">The Red-eyed Vireo!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Markings:</span> The trim little crown of the Red-eyed Vireo is of
gray color, bordered upon either side by a neat little band of
black. The eye of the bird is brick-red with a white line
directly above.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> Although this bird is not a member of the family of Warblers,
his habits are somewhat similar. Insect food is found
in the trees, shrubs, and bushes.</p>
<p>Mabel Osgood Wright has referred to the Red-eyed Vireo as a
bird of the mid-day. In her children&rsquo;s poem of nine stanzas,
entitled &ldquo;The Birds and the Hours,&rdquo; she says:</p>

<p class="t0">Who talks and preaches, yet keeps an eye</p>
<p class="t">On every stranger who passes by.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Red-eye has been known to become so tame that persons
have stroked a bird upon the back as she sat upon the nest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE GOLDFINCH</span></h2>
<p>One of the merriest of all the many birds is the Goldfinch, or
&ldquo;Wild Canary,&rdquo; as he is sometimes called. When winter, with its
biting cold and thick snow comes, we still find this cheerful
little bird, visiting with its many friends, perhaps perched on
some barren branch, twittering its gay little song to any who care
to listen. It is during these months that we find he has changed
his bright yellow coat for one of olive green. However, he still
wears his little black cap as his head covering.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> Not only does the Goldfinch resemble the Canary in color, but
his singing is quite canary-like, as well. His song is lively,
spontaneous and decidedly musical, often described as &ldquo;<i>per-chic-o-ree</i>.&rdquo;
It is frequently given as the bird is on the wing.
The flight is undulating and as the bird rises in a great upward
curve, a clear song, with its wild care-free quality, joyously
fills the air.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> The nest of the Goldfinch is sometimes found in low bushes or
in trees. It is one of the most beautiful structures that may
be seen out-of-doors. Fine grass and moss are used for the
exterior, while the very lightest of thistle-down is collected
for the soft nest lining. Fortunate, indeed, are the little
birds who are reared in this truly silken couch. The eggs,
three to six in number, are of a pale, bluish white color.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Remarks:</span> The female Goldfinch is much darker in color. Instead
of the black cap and black wings of the male, she is covered
with a brownish olive above, and a yellowish white beneath.
Indeed, she is much the more modest of the two. This
little &ldquo;Wild Canary,&rdquo; who sings as he flies, is as useful as he is
attractive. He eats objectionable weed seeds and other similar
food. He is greatly attracted by sun-flower seeds and he
would often come very close to our homes if we provided for
him. When we see the Goldfinch dipping through the air,
and hear his happy &ldquo;<i>per-chic-o-ree</i>,&rdquo; even from a distance we
can make no mistake about his identity; for of all the birds
that have definite habits, the Goldfinch is most characteristic
in his manner of flying.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD</span></h2>
<p>The only species of Hummingbird that we know in the Northeast
is the Ruby-throat. This little whirring jewel comes to us from
the South in very early May and departs by the first of October.
It is interesting to learn that there are at least five hundred known
species of Hummingbirds in the New World. They are found only
in North and South America, the greatest numbers being in South
America in Ecuador and Columbia, where Dr. Frank M. Chapman
writes that they inhabit the Andean regions.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Song:</span> The Ruby-throated Hummingbird utters only a little
&ldquo;squeak&rdquo; and thus may be said to possess no true song.
Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews has said that this note might
possibly mean&mdash;&ldquo;Look out now; don&rsquo;t attempt to catch me
by the tail while my head is buried in this morning-glory!&rdquo;
The &ldquo;humming&rdquo; sound is made by the rapidly beating wings.
Indeed, these wings move so rapidly that they are invisible
as the bird hovers in mid-air while investigating some flower.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Food:</span> The diet of this Hummingbird consists of tiny insects and
also of the nectar of flowers.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Nest:</span> This rare little structure is built upon a horizontal tree
limb, quite far from the ground. It is built of the very
softest of plant down, covered upon the outside with small
bits of lichens and bound to the branch with fibers. This
delicate little composition is most difficult to find. Often it is
only discovered by accident, perched upon its swaying foundation.
The two white eggs, about the size of beans, are incubated
and then the two diminutive birds appear in the silken
thimble. The entire family could be contained in a spoon.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">BIRD GAMES</span></h2>
<p>There are many different games that may be played to add
interest to a study of birds. Some of these are adaptable for out-of-doors
and some for the class room. One game that has proven
itself to be rather popular, is <i>a game of bird parts</i>.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Equipment:</span> For equipment it is necessary for the instructor to
have either a large colored picture or a real specimen of some
bird as the Meadowlark which is rather distinctively marked.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Rules:</span> First the instructor calls the attention of the children to
the various parts of the bird as outlined upon the chart in this
booklet. He then asks the children to stand and calls out such
body parts as the crown, the nape, the throat, and the shoulder
asking the children to put their hands quickly on the parts
of their bodies that are named. After this brief review the
instructor holds up a different bird and points to the different
parts such as the yellow nape of the Bobolink, the reddish
breast of the Grosbeak and asks the children to name quickly
the parts as they are indicated, at the same time placing
their hands upon these parts as before. The child who makes
a mistake is made to keep his hand where it is, and, by process
of elimination, with the use of several birds it is often possible
to find one child who has alone been undefeated.</p>
<h3 class="center">BIRDS&rsquo; NEST GAME</h3>
<p>In order to appreciate what wonderful structures birds&rsquo; nests
really are, it is sometimes helpful to try to build a nest.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Equipment:</span> Let each child gather several handfuls of dried grass,
short dead twigs, strips of inner bark, leaves and similar
nesting material. These may be brought to the classroom or
else the game may be played in the open.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="sc">Rules:</span> The instructor should give a brief talk on different types of
birds&rsquo; nests such as the Robins&rsquo; and Crows&rsquo;. For this purpose,
several real birds&rsquo; nests as examples would be most
useful. The children should be allowed a given time to
construct their nests. At the end of this period, it is just
barely possible that there may be one nestlike structure in the
group. This nest will of course be the winning one. This is
one way in which the children may appreciate the true birds&rsquo;
nests.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">THE MIGRATIONS OF LOCAL BIRDS</span></h2>
<p>Our local bird life may be divided roughly into two parts: the
<i>Permanent Residents</i> and the <i>Transients</i>. As Mr. Ludlow Griscom
has said &ldquo;It is idle to look for Warblers in January or Ducks in
July.&rdquo; We must know which of our birds are with us all the year
and which visit us for a short time. The following is a list that will
help us to tell <i>when</i> to look for different birds at different seasons.</p>
<p>A. <span class="sc">Permanent Residents.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the birds that are present during the months of
November, December, January and February are to be found
hereabouts during the entire year. These are the Crow,
several of the Owls, the Song Sparrow, the Partridge, etc.
However, we also have winter visitors, such as the Kinglets,
the Brown Creeper, the Snowbird and others that return
to the north during the warm season of the year.</p>

<h2 class="center"><span class="small">AN EARLY MORNING WITH THE BIRDS</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Wild birds change their season in the night.</p>
<p class="t0">And wail their way from cloud to cloud</p>
<p class="t0">Down the long wind.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One early October morning I lay on the hard-packed ground,
longing for the sun to rise. I had slept here all night long that I
might see the birds at dawn. Deceived by the warmth of the previous
day, I had not brought enough blankets and was therefore
exceedingly uncomfortable in the cold breeze.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill upon which stood my camp, there was a
spring-fed pond. Dammed at one end, it comfortably filled the
head of a small valley. Leading from it was a broad, grassy tidal
flat that receded from the visible Long Island Sound. To shore
birds this marshy place was an ideal feeding spot.</p>
<p>Over the dark, motionless surface of the lake there floated a
fog bank, suspended about twenty feet from the surface. More
vapor was slowly growing into a gigantic mushroom.</p>
<p>As I watched this increasing filmy mantle, I saw first one and
then another gray shape pass into it and disappear, only to emerge
again at some other point and vanish in the darkness of the oak-lined
shore. At first I could not imagine what these ghost-like
shapes were, and then, just as I had about decided that they
were the result of a freakish wind playing with stray cloudlets,
there came a gruff &ldquo;quawk, quawk, quawk,&rdquo; taken up by one and
then another of the shapes until the place echoed with hoarse
cries. I realized that the Black-crowned Night Heron was taking
his final morning sail preparatory to going to roost in some nearby
tree for the day. Like the owl, he preferred the night for his
activities.</p>
<p>Gradually the noise subsided as the Herons settled on various
branches. The mist above the pond began to disappear, and the
small, shapeless clouds far up in the sky took on a suggestion of
color. Now was the time to arise. In a very little while the
woods would be filled with flying, feeding birds, and the best time
of day for bird observation would be at hand. Yet so cold was I
that it was impossible to move a limb. Several times, off to one
side, a faint-voiced little White-throated Sparrow gave a feeble
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
imitation of his beautiful spring-and-summer song. It was as
though his vocal organs had become less pliant through disuse and
exposure to the cold.</p>
<p>What a brave little singer he is, even though his efforts are not
always equally repaid. I think it is partially what Hudson would
call the &ldquo;human note&rdquo; that so endears the White-throat&rsquo;s song to
me. There is truly an intimate quality in the first sustained note
of his song. But in the final, high and infinitely sweet tones there
is a suggestion of a song that is too pure to be voiced by anything
that is bound to the earth. Many have been the hot summer
days when, tired and pack-weary, I have paused for a moment to
rest at some bramble-covered clearing in the deep woods, and that
cheery little forest voice of the Peabody bird, coming unexpectedly
from some unseen branch, would refresh me as much as a drink at
some cool spring. I look forward to his singing from one year to
the next.</p>
<p>A massive white oak spread its powerful branches at least one
hundred feet above my head. It was a majestic and beautiful
living monument to a mighty nature. Some of the topmost limbs
seemed to reach up and disappear in the sky, so perfectly did their
pale gray bark blend with the early morning light. For some
time I listened to the soft rustling of the wind among its myriad
drying leaves. Then very subtly from the tree top there came a
different sound, which impressed itself upon my consciousness as
would the faint perfume of a distant flower bed slowly approached.
Gradually it increased until the leafy whispering became almost
inaudible, and the air was filled with an indescribable, high-pitched
musical breathing. It was as though countless tiny
creatures were conversing a great way off.</p>
<p>Turning squarely on my back, I for a moment saw nothing
in the leafy midst so far above. As my eyes became more properly
focussed, however, they distinguished some small objects of
about the same size. My glasses were safely stored in the heel of a
large shoe close at hand. Forgetting the chill air, I uncovered
my chest and arms long enough to take out the binoculars.</p>
<p>There in the tree top I saw a moving mass of very small birds
that were flying from one twig to another with scarcely any pause
in their activities. No sooner would one move out of sight than
another would come flying into the tree and take his place. The
entire gathering was ever going southward. A few of the number
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
came down to the lower branches where their identity could be
more readily determined. I realized that I was witnessing the fall
migration of a large group of American warblers.</p>
<p>Among the most prominent of the small birds were the female
and young Redstarts, who flashed into view many times. The
yellow on the outer tail feathers was plainly visible as they sped
here and there after any insect that might be about. The Myrtle
Warbler, with his four yellow spots on crown, rump, and on each
side of his breast, was very largely represented in the tree top.
The dainty little Yellow Warbler and the Black-throated Blue
were also there. What a multitude they were and what a long
fearsome journey they had yet to travel! It would be hard to
enumerate all of the various dangers that beset these little birds as
they fly mile after mile through the air at night, and more particularly
as they rest and feed near the ground during the day.</p>
<p>Even as I watched, a marauding Screech Owl glided overhead on
noiseless wings. Instantly the twittering died, only to be recommenced
after the Owl had passed quite harmlessly by.</p>
<p>What busy little creatures these birds were! They searched
every leaf and let no morsel of food, insect or plant, escape. How
well they knew that birds that fly in the night must feast in the
daytime. They were with me for about fifteen minutes, and then,
as gradually as they had come, so did they pass on until at last not
a single one was to be seen.</p>
<p>For some time I lay there trying vainly to warm myself after my
warbler exposure. Not a sound was to be heard&mdash;even the wind
had become silent. Then suddenly there came from not very far a
call of &ldquo;Teacher, Teacher, <i>Teacher</i>, TEACHER.&rdquo; Never before or
since have I heard the &ldquo;teacher bird&rdquo; announce himself so late in
the season. He was also on his journey southward. His smaller
brother warblers took to the tree tops but he, although of the same
family, preferred the ground where he might look among the
leaves for choice bits of food. This bird is known by a diversity of
names. He is called by many the &ldquo;oven-bird&rdquo;, due to the Dutch-oven-like
structure of his nest; but to me he is, as he was to John
Burroughs, the &ldquo;Teacher Bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I go off alone into the woods I want some sort of &ldquo;burglar
alarm&rdquo; to warn me of strangers in camp on windless nights. I
resort to a very ancient but effective practice. By gathering
many armfuls of dry, dead leaves and piling them all about my
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
tent I feel fairly sure that no prowler can take me by surprise.
I had provided myself with just such an alarm on this overnight
hike, and was made aware by a slight rustling close to my tent
that I had a caller of some kind. For a moment I thought it
was a gray squirrel, but then the nature of the noise seemed
different and I was puzzled as to who my visitor might be.</p>
<p>In a moment I found out. A most beautiful, clean-cut little
Wood Thrush came hopping along before my tent. He looked
very cold, and for that reason aroused my sympathy at once.
His shapely brown head was tucked down between the shoulder
blades as far as possible. So cold was he that he did not even look
for food, but with no apparent thought as to direction, moved
along evidently just to keep warm. It gave me a mental picture
of myself as I would be when I arose. My main object would be to
get the fire going so as to keep warm; food would come later.</p>
<p>The Thrush passed out of my sight without having paid any
attention to me. I thought him gone for all time; but no, in a
moment he reappeared and to my intense delight came stalking
straight towards the tent, still in the frozen manner.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I am positive, he saw me. His head was taken from
between the shoulders, and every part of the bird seemed instantly
on the alert. The contrast was startling. Here was a
most active and intelligent creature where before had been one
that looked remarkably dull and stupid.</p>
<p>Slowly, and with the utmost caution, he advanced until not
more than two feet separated us. There he stopped and literally
looked me up and down. Not a sound nor a movement did I
make, so fearful was I of frightening my guest away. What a
remarkably clean white breast he had, and how distinct were the
round black spots with which it was speckled! Here was the
woodland brother of the Robin and the Bluebird right where I
could put my hand on him. After he had become satisfied that I
was harmless and was no more interesting than any of the queer-looking
fallen logs or rocks of the forest, he turned his back,
rather rudely, and left the tent.</p>
<p>It was then that I arose and went about my fire making. If the
birds were so anxious to have me see them that they were forced to
come into my tent I could no longer refuse them. A hasty breakfast
over, I started off into the woods, glasses in hand, in quest
of the birds that were calling.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
